# Weather Data Dashboard

This project is a Python-based application that fetches weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays it in an interactive dashboard. The dashboard includes a table of weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description) and visualizations (bar chart and pie chart) created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The dashboard is built using **Streamlit**, making it easy to use and share.

---

## Features

1. API Integration:
   - Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - Supports any city worldwide.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Displays weather metrics in a table.
   - Creates a **bar chart** for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
   - Creates a **pie chart** for the weather description.

3. Interactive Dashboard:
   - Built using **Streamlit**.
   - Allows users to input a city name and view weather data instantly.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Python 3.7 or higher:
   - Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Required Python Libraries:

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-data-dashboard.git
   cd weather-data-dashboardReplace the API Key:

Open the dashboard.py file.

Replace "your_api_key_here" with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

Run the Dashboard:

Start the Streamlit app using the following command:

bash
Copy
streamlit run dashboard.py
A new tab will open in your browser with the Weather Data Dashboard.

Use the Dashboard:

Enter a city name in the input box (e.g., "London").
